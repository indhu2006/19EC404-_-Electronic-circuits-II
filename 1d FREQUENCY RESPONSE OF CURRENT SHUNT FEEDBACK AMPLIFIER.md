### **Result**

Thus the current shunt feedback amplifier is designed and constructed  and the following parameters are calculated.
| S.No | Parameters | Without Feedback | With Feedback |
|:----:|-------------|:----------------:|:--------------:|
| 1 | Lower cut-off frequency |f1 = 0.4KHZ |f1 = 0.5KHZ |
| 2 | Upper cut-off frequency |f2 =140KHZ |f2 = 520KHZ|
| 3 | Bandwidth | BW = 139.6KHZ | BW = 519.5KHZ |
| 4 | Mid-band Gain | AVMID = 7.36 | AVMID = 3.21 |
| 5 | Gain at half power point | G0 = 4.71 | G0 = 2.1 |


---

**Conclusion:**  
The frequency response of the current shunt feedback amplifier was studied. It was observed that the **gain decreases** while the **bandwidth increases** when negative feedback is applied, confirming the theoretical expectations.
