### **Result**

Thus the current series  feedback amplifier is designed and constructed  and the following parameters are calculated.
| S.No | Parameters | Without Feedback | With Feedback |
|:----:|-------------|:----------------:|:--------------:|
| 1 | Lower cut-off frequency | f1 =  0.64KHZ|f1= 0.45KHZ |
| 2 | Upper cut-off frequency |f2 = 300KHZ|f2 = 400KHZ |
| 3 | Bandwidth | BW = 299.4KHZ | BW = 399.55KHZ |
| 4 | Mid-band Gain | AVMID = 12.88| AVMID = 8.40 |
| 5 | Gain at half power point |G0 = 9.40  |G0 = 5.93  |


---

**Conclusion:**  
The frequency response of the current series feedback amplifier was studied. It was observed that the **gain decreases** while the **bandwidth increases** when negative feedback is applied, confirming the theoretical expectations.
